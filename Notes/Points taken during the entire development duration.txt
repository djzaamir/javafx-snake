-> Ok so  , that the very basic structure of the snake game has been setup

-> I'm thinking of two approaches for developing a single snake

     1) Create a snake class which will have just the cords of the snake and its body parts
        and also some enviromental information like , IsAlive , IsHittingWall , IsHittingItSelf etc.
        
         * The pros of this approach , well apparently it looks like that managing it and implementing it feels more straight forword.
         * because we will travering snakes body cords , and while doing it generate a new circle at the cord.
         * Also all of the game logic can go inside the snake object.
         * GUI or display code will be handles in Main thread i-e Main class that has implemted Start method for javaFx.


     2) Another approach will i am thinking about is , that we can make it a little complex but cleaner
         * what i want to do is , this 
              -> I want to make Snake objects more indepedent of Main thread 
              -> This way all of the actual body objects (GUI OBjects) will be pushed inside the snake along with the game logic
         * Using the above will make the code more independant more OPP like , more clearner but a little bit more complex
         * Because we have to joint the GUI objects from the snake to the main thread some  how

    
      3) Can we have somewhat a hybrid approach ???

            *We can keep the logic , cords , enviromental data into the snake
            * Then make some functions in the main thread that will be responsible to draw GUI elements based on snake objects

-> check , can i control the speed of game loop very important         //This works fine as well
-> check how can i change the position of the circle on the screen     //This works fine as well
-> check how to manipulate the value of color using random function    //This works fine 	
-> How to place a small menu bar at the top of game                    //This can be handled as well
-> A way to display score on somwhere appropriate                      //This is managable as well

=========================Ok so after alot of brainstorming and small experiments , i've reached this conclusion that i am going to be using approach number one
                         to design my snake body parts objects as well as the whole snake as well ==============================================================

-> i am now able to display a single point of snake body
-> Now will abstract more stuff from the Main class and try to wrap it inside the core Snake obj. //Done
-> able to display multiple points / parts of body onto the screen   //Yup
-> I am facing this issue of redrawing elements on their new cordinates using javaFx canvas. //Done its fixed now
-> Now able to generate food
-> And also now able to do some collision detectionn and take appropriate operations against it


=======================Mile-Stone acheived basic simple snake game is now in working state=======================================================================


-> Recent discovered issues
    *  Main window is not display properly , white area is left out right next to green portion. //Fixed , by Fixing the scene size to 1250 and Canvas width to 1300
    *  Weired looking black dot is trailing the snake. //Will be fixing it later , doesnt look very bad at slow speeds

   ? *  Control the speed of snake (AnimationTimer Class).
    
   ? *  Late input detection. //Probably linked with the speed issue. (Possible solution take input in a seprate thread)
    *  Weired looking trailing trails while moving at top and down borders.
    *  Probably need to change the logic of the game to GAME-OVER when a wall is HIT.
    *  But this is not a good approach , i also need to find the long term solution , what the hell is wrong  with the game at TOP and DOWN borders
    *  Snake and food is not lined up , what this means is that the (x,y) cords might not match every time a snake hits a food
          they will hit eventually but it  will be not very smooth.


                                          ==============MILE STONE ACHEIVED FOOD IS not being eaten====================


  -> Next targets (Relatively Small targets)
       *Although the collision dectection with food looks good and dandy but still show it to others and let them decide is it good enough? 
       * fix the game logic to die on collision
       * FIX THE LATE INPUT DETECTION , IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED.
       * Do Something about the score card
       * Add funcionalities into the menus
       * snake size increases when a new food is eaten

  -> Next major mile stones
       * Introduce another snake
       * Introduce AI controlled snake
       * introuce sound
       * change background
       * Store score locally and on server , while asking for names and some sort of PK related to each user



   ->Pack the game into Executable Jar or exe file , and share it with frinds , it should run on most of the pcs
