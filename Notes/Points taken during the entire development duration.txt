-> Ok so  , that the very basic structure of the snake game has been setup

-> I'm thinking of two approaches for developing a single snake

     1) Create a snake class which will have just the cords of the snake and its body parts
        and also some enviromental information like , IsAlive , IsHittingWall , IsHittingItSelf etc.
        
         * The pros of this approach , well apparently it looks like that managing it and implementing it feels more straight forword.
         * because we will travering snakes body cords , and while doing it generate a new circle at the cord.
         * Also all of the game logic can go inside the snake object.
         * GUI or display code will be handles in Main thread i-e Main class that has implemted Start method for javaFx.


     2) Another approach will i am thinking about is , that we can make it a little complex but cleaner
         * what i want to do is , this 
              -> I want to make Snake objects more indepedent of Main thread 
              -> This way all of the actual body objects (GUI OBjects) will be pushed inside the snake along with the game logic
         * Using the above will make the code more independant more OPP like , more clearner but a little bit more complex
         * Because we have to joint the GUI objects from the snake to the main thread some  how

    
      3) Can we have somewhat a hybrid approach ???

            *We can keep the logic , cords , enviromental data into the snake
            * Then make some functions in the main thread that will be responsible to draw GUI elements based on snake objects

-> check , can i control the speed of game loop very important         //This works fine as well
-> check how can i change the position of the circle on the screen     //This works fine as well
-> check how to manipulate the value of color using random function    //This works fine 	
-> How to place a small menu bar at the top of game                    //This can be handled as well
-> A way to display score on somwhere appropriate                      //

=========================Ok so after alot of brainstorming and small experiments , i've reached this conclusion that i am going to be using approach number one
                         to design my snake body parts objects as well as the whole snake as well ==============================================================
